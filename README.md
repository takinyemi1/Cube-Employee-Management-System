# Cube Employee Management System

**Cube Employee Management System** is a website application developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This application allows a user to identify themselves as an administrator or an employee. If they are an administrator, they can mark employees as present, absent, or sick, and view and edit their salaries. As an employee, they can review each of those factors, but without the edit property.
